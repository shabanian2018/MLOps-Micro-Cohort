## üîç Overview

High-dimensional transcriptomic data + small cohorts = overfitting.  
This project introduces a biologically informed classification pipeline for micro-cohorts (<30 subjects), integrating:

- üß™ **Paired-sample transcriptomics** (e.g., tumor vs. normal)
- üß¨ **N-of-1 pathway analytics** (Wilcoxon-based GO enrichment per subject)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Reproducible MLOps** with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) (versioning, sweep tuning, logging)
- üìâ **Retroactive Ablation** analysis to validate feature robustness

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why MLOps?  

Traditional ML scripts often fail in biomedical research because they:  
- are **hard to reproduce**,  
- lack **version control**,  
- do not **scale** to multiple experiments, and  
- rarely include **monitoring or audit trails**.  

MLOps brings the discipline of DevOps to ML workflows. In this project, we use [Weights & Biases (W&B)](https://wandb.ai/) to implement:

- **Experiment Tracking** ‚Üí Every run, dataset version, and hyperparameter is automatically logged.  
- **Automated Hyperparameter Sweeps** ‚Üí YAML-based sweeps ensure reproducible model optimization.  
- **Code & Data Versioning** ‚Üí Ensures that exact models can be reconstructed months or years later.  
- **End-to-End Automation** ‚Üí From preprocessing, training, validation, to deployment ‚Äî all orchestrated programmatically.  
- **Continuous Monitoring** ‚Üí Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) and feature importances are tracked in real time.  

‚û°Ô∏è In complex biomedical ML projects, MLOps provides **scalability, transparency, and accountability**.
